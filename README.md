Comp Guide User Manual:
The first page:
When you get to the comp guide website, you will be prompted to log in. If you do not have an account, you can make one by registering. You must type in your desired username, email address, and password in order to make an account. The email address must be a Harvard College email address. If the address isn’t then the user will be prompted to input a harvard email address. 

After you Log-In
Once you have logged in to comp-guide, you will be directed to the homepage that displays all of the club comps that have been reviewed by peers. To access the reviews and other data collected, you must click on the name of the club. You will then be redirected to a page with graphics, reviews, and pieces of advice left by previous compers of the club. These components all update as new reviews are submitted by other users of the website. 

Submitting a review
To submit a review on a particular club, you can click on the “Review” tab on the navigation bar on any screen. You will be brought to a form that asks you what club you are writing a review for and a variety of questions about the comp process for that particular club. One feature is that you are not able to review a club that is not officially recognized by the college. When you type the official name of the club in the “name” bar, you click on the desired club. If the club you have typed has not popped up on the search bar, then that club is not officially registered with Harvard SOCO. You will receive an error if you try to submit a review to a club that doesn’t pop up. 

Can I submit Multiple Reviews? 
You can submit reviews to as many clubs but you can only write 1 review per club. 

Are reviews anonymous?
Yes, reviews are anonymous. There is no filtration for “false” reviews, so there is an honor system regarding whether a review is true or not. 

Forgot Password? 
If you have forgotten your password for your Comp Guide account, you can click “forgot password” and have a password reset link sent to your registered email address.
